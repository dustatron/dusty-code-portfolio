                This is the second iteration of a tool that allows people to vote on what movie to watch for 
                a movie night.

                This was created with Ruby on Rails and uses The Movie Database API to allow 
                a signed in user to easlier search for a movie and then add it to the ballot.  Users can up 
                vote or down vote movies and leave comments about the movies.
